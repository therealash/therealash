👋 I'm a **tech enthusiast**, journeying through life from the colorful corners of India to the picturesque landscapes of Germany.

👨‍👩‍👦 Living a blissful life with my better half and our 8-year-old mini-me.

💼 Here's a snapshot of my professional journey:
- 🖥️ Emerged in the tech world as a **Full Stack Developer**, mastering the arts of PHP and Vue.js
- Collaborated with many people, and companies from different parts of the globe. 
- 🌉 Currently steering the ship as an **Application Manager** in a company that's a catalyst for brand-retailer collaborations.

🔭 Despite the shift, my heart still beats for coding:
- 💻 Keenly interested in **PHP and Vue.js**.
- 🌐 Always ready to dive into open-source contributions or exciting ventures.

🎬 When the tech world doesn't keep me busy, you'll find me:
- 🍿 Enjoying a good movie, or
- 📚 Lost in the world of books.
